h2. Installation

<pre>
# Go home
cd ~

# Clone mine or your own fork
git clone git://github.com/spf13/profile.git .profile.d

# All *.conf files are loaded alphabetically, so this will retain your original settings
mv .profile .profile.d/z_myoldsettings.conf

# .profile.d/init kicks off the whole thing
ln -s .profile.d/init .profile

# Make sure you don't have any .bash_profile or .bashrc hanging out which might override .profile
# and reload your profile
source .profile
</pre>

h2. Usage
Once installed you can now put any @*.conf@ in @~/.profile.d@ and it'll get loaded in alphabetical order. You can also put conf files in @~/.profile.d/`uname`@ to get platform-specific configuration or @~/.profile.d/$USER@ to get user-specific configuration. The load order (defined in the @init@ file) is:

# .profile.d/init
# .profile.d/<notextile>*</notextile>.conf
# .profile.d/$USER/<notextile>*</notextile>.conf
# .profile.d/`uname`/<notextile>*</notextile>.conf
# .profile.d/$USER/`uname`/<notextile>*</notextile>.conf
